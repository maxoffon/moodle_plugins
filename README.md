## About

Moodle theme plugin. Based on general Moodle theme Boost

## Implementation

<b style="color: orange">1st way (preferable)</b>:<br>
* Save the repository as a ZIP archive. Next, go to the Moodle-based platform as an administrator in the Administration section. Go to the Plugins section and select the Plugins Installation function. Use the ZIP archive you downloaded earlier as an installation package and apply the changes.

<b style="color: orange">2nd way (manual)</b>:<br>
* Save the repository as a ZIP archive. In the head folder of your Moodle platform go to the local theme folder [*/moodle/theme]. Create a folder and name it "max". Put all files in the main folder of the archive you've downloaded earlier in "max" folder. Refresh the Moodle platform page.
* You can just clone the repository to the [*/moodle/theme/max] folder as well.
